# Hey!

I'm Liam. I'm a friendly full stack software developer based out of the UK. I currently specialise in TypeScript, but I'm looking to also learn Swift and/or Rust.
I currently work [@theshoregroup](https://github.com/theshoregroup) where I've worked as both a Lead Developer and SysAdmin.

Personally, I'm currently building my website in public! See [limegorilla/super-lamp](https://github.com/limegorilla/super-lamp) 
You can also view a personal roadmap [here](https://github.com/users/limegorilla/projects/2/views/1)

The repository you are on serves a few purposes - the main being a general place for me to house generic/global or misc issues that do not correspond to one project. This can be anything from infrastructure to documentation, and will generally originate from my personal <a href="https://github.com/users/limegorilla/projects/2/">roadmap</a>
