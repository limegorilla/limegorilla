# Hey!

I'm Liam. I'm a friendly full stack software developer based out of the UK. I currently specialise in TypeScript, but I'm looking to also learn Swift and/or Rust.
I currently work [@theshoregroup](https://github.com/theshoregroup) where I've worked as both a Lead Developer and SysAdmin.

Personally, I'm currently building my website in public! See https://github.com/limegorilla/super-lamp  
You can also view a personal roadmap [here](https://github.com/users/limegorilla/projects/2/views/1)
